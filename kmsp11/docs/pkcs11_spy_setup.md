# Setting Up PKCS #11 Tool and PKCS #11 Spy

## Requirements

This guide provides instructions for setting up PKCS #11 Tool and PKCS #11 Spy
for debugging purposes on Debian 10 (Buster). You may follow these instructions
if you are using another OS or environment, but be aware that there may be
slight differences.

> TODO(b/175421728): Add non-internal build download link.

This guide assumes that you have downloaded the latest linux amd64 < release
build > and have a yaml configuration file ready to go.

Remember to point `KMS_PKCS11_CONFIG` at your config file with:

```
export KMS_PKCS11_CONFIG="/path/to/pkcs11-config.yaml"
```

We need the `opensc` package, which contains `pkcs11-tool` and `pkcs11-spy`:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install opensc
```

## Using PKCS #11 Tool

You can test out your yaml configuration by running

```
pkcs11-tool --module /path/to/libkmsp11.so -I
```

which should provide you with some basic information about the PKCS #11 Cloud
KMS Library. Make sure that the library version is the one you expect.

`pkcs11-tool` can be used to test out the KMS library and perform basic crypto
operations through its cli. For instance, you can sign a digest like this:

```
echo -n "hello world" | openssl dgst -binary -sha256 > data.txt

pkcs11-tool --module /path/to/libkmsp11.so --sign --mechanism ECDSA --slot 0 --label test-key-ec \
   --type privkey -i data.txt -o signature.sig
```

NOTE: the path to `libkmsp11.so` should be a full path, not a relative path.

The OpenSC configuration has a debug level variable, which can be overwritten
using the `OPENSC_DEBUG` environment variable. For example you can use:

```
OPENSC_DEBUG=9 pkcs11-tool --list-slots
```

TIP: you may want to try the `-M` flag, to list all the mechanisms supported by
the KMS library, and `-O` to list the objects (CryptoKeys) available for use
based on your yaml configuration.

## Setting up PKCS #11 Spy

PKCS#11 Spy is a special PKCS#11 Module that sits between your application and
your real PKCS#11 Module, and creates a log file with all functions calls by the
application and return values by the real PKCS#11 Module. It does not change the
communication in any way.

IMPORTANT: Be aware such log files are security sensitive. Since all information
is logged, you should only use it for debugging and preferably with test keys.

To use PKCS#11 Spy on Linux and MacOS, set the following environment variables:

```
export PKCS11SPY="/path/to/libkmsp11.so"
# Optional, stderr will be used for logging if not set
export PKCS11SPY_OUTPUT="/path/to/pkcs11-spy.log"
```

To capture the logs, you should now run your application using the
`pkcs11-spy.so` module, instead of the KMS library. For instance, if using
`pkcs11-tool` on a Debian linux distribution:

```
pkcs11-tool --module /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11/pkcs11-spy.so -I
```

Your `pkcs11-spy.log` file should now contain a full step-by-step breakdown of
the PKCS #11 functions executed.
